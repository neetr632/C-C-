

Namespace:

// Defines the set of identifiers that are visible and accessible within a particular scope.
// Organizes identifiers into distinct categories or groups, such as labels, tags, members of structs/unions, and ordinary identifiers.
// Helps avoid naming conflicts by ensuring that identifiers in different namespaces do not clash.
// Namespaces are specific to different language constructs and can have different rules and visibility scopes.

Scope:

// Defines the region of a program where a particular identifier is valid and accessible.
// Determines the visibility and lifetime of identifiers.
// Identifiers declared within a scope are accessible only within that scope, unless shadowed by another identifier with the same name in an inner scope.
// Scopes can be nested, with inner scopes having access to identifiers declared in outer scopes.

In summary, namespaces organize identifiers into distinct categories, 
while scopes define the visibility and accessibility of identifiers within a program. 
Namespaces help manage the naming of identifiers to avoid conflicts, 
while scopes define where identifiers can be accessed and how long they remain valid.
