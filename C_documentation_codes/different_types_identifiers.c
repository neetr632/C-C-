/**
 * Sure, here are summaries of the different kinds of identifiers mentioned:

Label Names: Identifiers declared as labels. These are used to mark specific points in the code, typically for use with control flow statements like goto.

Tag Names: Identifiers declared as names of structs, unions, and enumerated types. All three kinds of tags share one namespace.

Member Names: Identifiers declared as members of structs or unions. Each struct and union introduces its own namespace for member names.

Global Attribute Names: Attribute tokens defined by the standard or implementation-defined attribute prefixes. These attributes can modify the behavior of code and are often used for compiler-specific features.

Non-Standard Attribute Names: Attribute names following attribute prefixes. Each attribute prefix has a separate namespace for the implementation-defined attributes it introduces. These attributes are typically custom extensions provided by specific compilers.

Ordinary Identifiers: All other identifiers, including function names, object names (variables), typedef names, and enumeration constants. These are the most common types of identifiers used in C programs and cover a wide range of entities in the code.
